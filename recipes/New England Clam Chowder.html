	<h2>Description<h2>
	<p>From Manhattan to New England, clam chowder is known for its competing varieties as much as for its comforting briny flavor. 
		It seems every state on the East Coast has its own take on the popular soup — and even some of the West Coast states have 
		tweaked the recipe to make it their own. Whether you like a thick creamy base, a bold red broth, or a clear broth of clam juice, 
		there's a chowder for every soup lover. Here's a little history behind the famous soup and it's many iterations.
	</p>
	<p>According to Merriam-Webster Dictionary, the definition of chowder is "a soup or stew of seafood (as clams or fish) usually made with 
		milk or tomatoes, salt pork, onions, and other vegetables." While there are different types of chowder, the clam variety is undoubtedly 
		the most well-known. The definition of the soup varies depending what part of the country you're in, but most include clams, potatoes, onions, 
		and some form of pork. The biggest different between them is the broth: Some use milk to produce a thick, creamy broth, others use a red broth 
		made with tomatoes and spices, and there's also a clear broth made from clam juice. While each region may prepare chowder differently, they all 
		share one thing in common: all feel their clam chowder is the best.
