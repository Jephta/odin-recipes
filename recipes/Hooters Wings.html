	<h2>Description<h2>
	<p>Our traditional, bone-in wings are marinated overnight, then smoked over hickory chips to seal in that rich, 
		smoky flavor. Choose from one of our three dry rubs - Texas BBQ, Jerk, or Garlic Habanero - or get them hand-tossed 
		in your favorite wing sauce.

		Hooters hot wings are battered.  Most hot wing recipes simply fry the wings. But, by adding this crispy batter to the chicken wings, the 
		outside of the wing gives you more flavor and more crunchy bits!
